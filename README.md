# Advent of Code

This repository contains Haskell programs to solve Advent of Code puzzles.

## How to Run

I use cabal to setup everything, so just run

```
cabal build
```

Or alternatively, run

```
cabal build day##
```

where `##` is the day number, left padded with zeroes to two digits.

After building, run

```
cabal run day##
```

and voil√°!
